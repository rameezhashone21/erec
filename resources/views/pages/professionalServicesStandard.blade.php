                        hereby accepts the engagement, to provide Services within the terms and conditions set out in this
                        Agreement.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">2. Services. E-REC Group Pty Ltd shall provide Services to you as set out in
                        this Agreement or any other documents or terms provided by E-REC Group Pty Ltd to you.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">3. Confidentiality. Confidential Information of a Party means: (a) the
                        details of the Services; (b) price information of the Services; (c) the terms of this Agreement; (d)
                        information or material proprietary to or deemed to be proprietary to you or E-REC Group Pty Ltd
                        (collectively, the “Party”); (e) information designated as confidential by either Party; (f)
                        information acquired by either Party solely by virtue of provision of the Services; (g) trade
                        secrets of either Party; (h) intellectual property rights; and extends to all forms of storage or
                        representation of the Confidential Information including, but not limited to, loose notes diaries,
                        memoranda, drawings, photographs, electronic storage and computer print-outs. Confidential
                        Information excludes any Confidential Information, or any portion thereof, which: (a) from the date
                        from which any of the information becomes publicly available; (b) is disclosed to either Party by a
                        third party and either Party reasonably believes the third party is legally entitled to disclose
                        such information; (c) was known to either Party prior to its receipt from the other Party; (d) is
                        developed by either Party independently of any disclosures previously made by the other Party; (e)
                        is disclosed with the other Party’s prior written consent; (f) is required to be disclosed by either
                        Party by order of the court, other legal processes or other professional standard. Both Parties
                        agree that Confidential Information disclosed to the other shall be used solely in connection with
                        the provision of the Services. Both Parties agree that they shall carry out their obligations
                        hereunder using the same degree of care that is used in protecting their own proprietary
                        information, but always at least a reasonable degree of care. Provided that both Parties shall have
                        met the foregoing standard of care, neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any inadvertent
                        or accidental disclosure by either Party of Confidential Information. Neither Party shall use the
                        Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than in the lawful carrying out of
                        its obligations under this Agreement</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">B. Responsibilities of the Parties.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">1. Scope. E-REC Group Pty Ltd will work to the best of its ability towards
                        meeting your needs in a timely and efficient manner. The assignment is confined to the work
                        specified in a Statement of Work. Extensions to the scope of the assignment require the written
                        Agreement from both Parties. Where you require additional work to be performed, reasonable
                        additional fees are payable by you to E-REC Group Pty Ltd. Consulting work can experience unforeseen
                        delays and this depends to a degree on factors outside E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s control. If E-REC Group
                        Pty Ltd is prevented from meeting its obligation due to causes beyond its control it will be
                        entitled to a reasonable extension of time for performance of the work.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">2. Use of Reports and Recommendations. The provision of Services by E-REC
                        Group Pty Ltd may include a report or letter stating findings, conclusions and recommendations. Such
                        a report or letter will be prepared by E-REC Group Pty Ltd for distribution or circulation as agreed
                        in the proposal or report. Accordingly, such reports or letters may not be reproduced or used for
                        any other purpose without E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s written permission. E-REC Group Pty Ltd assumes no
                        responsibility or liability for loss to you or any other Parties as a result of the circulation,
                        publication or reproduction of the contents of such reports or letters contrary to the provisions of
                        this paragraph. It is understood and agreed that Services may include advice and recommendations.
                        All decisions in connection with the implementation of such advice and recommendations shall be the
                        responsibility of, and made by, you.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">3. Sources of Information. The advice, conclusions and recommendation of
                        E-REC Group Pty Ltd may be based on information provided by you or third parties. Unless
                        specifically stated, no form of independent verification or audit of such information is undertaken
                        and E-REC Group Pty Ltd is not responsible for the accuracy of information supplied by you or third
                        parties. Furthermore, E-REC Group Pty Ltd reserves the right to amend its conclusions or
                        recommendations in the light of any material omissions or misstatements that subsequently become
                        known.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">4. Qualified Personnel. E-REC Group Pty Ltd is responsible for the provision
                        of qualified consultants and other personnel to carry out E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s obligations under
                        the contract and reserves the right to substitute staff on an assignment.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">5. Management. In cases involving the appointment by you of one of E-Rec’s
                        nominees to a temporary executive role, E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s responsibility (including that of its
                        nominee) is limited to the application of established management principles. You acknowledge that
                        the nominee although experienced in such principles is not necessarily experienced in your specific
                        operations. In such circumstances, the Consultant assumes no greater responsibility than that which
                        would pertain to your employee performing a similar role.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">6. Machines and Other Goods. E-REC Group Pty Ltd is not responsible for
                        delays in the delivery or faulty performance or quality of machines or other goods purchased or
                        otherwise obtained by you from others on the advice of E-REC Group Pty Ltd.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">7. Compensation. For the Services provided by E-REC Group Pty Ltd under this
                        Agreement you shall compensate E-REC Group Pty Ltd as agreed between the Parties.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">8. Expenses. You shall reimburse E-REC Group Pty Ltd for all reasonable
                        out-of-pocket expenses incurred by E-REC Group Pty Ltd in performing its Services hereunder
                        (including, without limitation, all reasonable travel, meal, lodging and mileage expenses) in
                        accordance with E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s standard policies as they exist from time to time.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">9. Payment of Fees and Expenses. Unless otherwise noted in any particular
                        Statement of Work, E-REC Group Pty Ltd shall invoice you at the end of each month for E-REC Group
                        Pty Ltd’s fees for its Services performed under this Agreement prior to the issue of the invoice and
                        out-of-pocket expenses incurred by E-REC Group Pty Ltd prior to the issue of the invoice. Payment of
                        E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s invoices are due on thirty (30) day terms. Properly submitted invoices upon
                        which payment is not received by due date shall accrue a late charge at any annualized equivalent
                        rate of 12% interest per annum from the time the payment was due. Without limiting its rights or
                        remedies, excepting where such invoices are in dispute, E-REC Group Pty Ltd shall have the right to
                        halt or terminate entirely its Services until payment is received on past due invoices. If GST has
                        application to any supply made under this Agreement, E-REC Group Pty Ltd may, in addition to any
                        amount or consideration expressed as payable elsewhere in this Agreement, recover from you an
                        additional amount on account of the GST, such amount to be calculated by multiplying the amount or
                        consideration payable by you for the supply by the prevailing GST rate.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">10. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the date specified as the
                        Effective Date. If there is no date, the commencement date is the date of chronological later
                        signature of the persons signing this Agreement and, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the
                        provisions hereof, shall terminate on the completion of the Services. Notwithstanding the provisions
                        of the preceding Paragraph, either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon giving notice
                        to the other Party not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the termination date. The
                        obligations of any Party which have been incurred prior to the termination date shall continue in
                        full force and effect notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement and whether or
                        not an invoice has been rendered with respect thereto.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">C. Ownership and General.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">1. E-REC Group Pty Ltd Technology. E-REC Group Pty Ltd has created, acquired
                        or otherwise has rights in, and may, in connection with the performance of Services hereunder,
                        employ, provide, modify, create, acquire or otherwise obtain rights in, various concepts, ideas,
                        methods, methodologies, procedures, techniques, processes, know-how, and models (including, without
                        limitation, function, process, system and templates; the generalized features of the structure,

                        consulting and software tools, utilities and routines; and logic, coherence and methods of operation

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">2. Ownership of Deliverables. Except as provided below, upon full and final
                        payment to E-REC Group Pty Ltd hereunder, the tangible items specified as deliverables (the
                        “Deliverables”) remain the property of E-REC Group Pty Ltd.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">3. Ownership of E-REC Group Pty Ltd Property. To the extent that E-REC Group
                        Pty Ltd utilises any of its property (including, without limitation, the E-REC Group Pty Ltd
                        Technology or any hardware or software of E-REC Group Pty Ltd) in connection with the performance of
                        Services hereunder, such property shall remain the property of E-REC Group Pty Ltd and, except for
                        the license expressly granted in the preceding paragraph, you shall acquire no right or interest in
                        such property. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as precluding or limiting in any way the
                        right of E-REC Group Pty Ltd to provide consulting or other services of any kind or nature
                        whatsoever to any person or entity as E-REC Group Pty Ltd in its sole discretion deems appropriate.
                        In addition, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge
                        and agree that (a) E-REC Group Pty Ltd will own all right, title, and interest, including, without
                        limitation, all rights under all copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws, in and to
                        the E-REC Group Pty Ltd Technology and (b) E-REC Group Pty Ltd may employ, modify, disclose, and
                        otherwise exploit the E-REC Group Pty Ltd Technology (including, without limitation, providing
                        Services or creating programming or materials for other clients). You acknowledges that Intellectual
                        Property Rights in the material existing prior to the provision of Services under this Agreement
                        including E-REC Group Pty Ltd Methodologies and E-REC Group Pty Ltd Software Tools and Technology,
                        all material provided or used by E-REC Group Pty Ltd in providing the Services, and all enhancements
                        thereof shall remain vested in E-REC Group Pty Ltd, and that nothing in the Agreement shall prevent,
                        limit or restrict subsequent use of this material by E-REC Group Pty Ltd.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">4. Return of Materials. Upon completion of the provision of the Services, or
                        earlier termination of the Agreement, and when requested in writing, E-REC Group Pty Ltd shall
                        return to you all of your materials, and you shall return to E-REC Group Pty Ltd all E-REC Group Pty
                        Ltd property, including E-REC Group Pty Ltd Technology provided under this Agreement.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">5. Limitation on Warranties. E-REC Group Pty Ltd shall perform its Services
                        hereunder in good faith. E-REC Group Pty Ltd is primarily providing Services under this Agreement,
                        and the provision of any tangible items hereunder shall be deemed an incidental part of the Services
                        and as much as possible not the sale of goods within the meaning of any applicable Trade Practices
                        Act, Competition & Consumer, Sale of Goods or similar legislation. To the extent allowable by law
                        E-REC Group Pty Ltd disclaims all other warranties, either express, implied or statutory, including,
                        without limitation, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Global
                        competition & consumer acts, like the Australian Competition & Consumer Act 2010 as amended, and
                        other statutes from time to time in force in any country may imply conditions and warranties upon
                        E-REC Group Pty Ltd which cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified except to a limited extent.
                        The Agreement must be read and interpreted subject to any such statutory provisions. The liability
                        of E-REC Group Pty Ltd to any such statutory provisions shall be limited, at the option of E-REC
                        Group Pty Ltd: (i) the supplying of the Services again; or (ii) the payment of the cost of having
                        the Services supplied again.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">6. Limitation on Damages. You agree that E-REC Group Pty Ltd, its
                        principals, members and employees shall not be liable to you for any actions, damages, claims,
                        liabilities, costs, expenses, or losses in any way arising out of or relating to the Services
                        performed hereunder for an aggregate amount in excess of the fees already paid by you to E-REC Group
                        Pty Ltd under this Agreement at the time action is commenced against E-REC Group Pty Ltd. In no
                        event shall E-REC Group Pty Ltd, its principals, members or employees be liable for consequential,
                        special, indirect, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages, costs, expenses, or losses (including,
                        without limitation, lost profits and opportunity costs). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
                        foregoing, E-REC Group Pty Ltd will not be liable in respect of any decisions made by you as a
                        result of the performance by E-REC Group Pty Ltd of its Services hereunder. The provisions of this
                        Paragraph shall apply regardless of the form of action, damage, claim, liability, cost, expense, or
                        loss, whether in contract, statute, tort (including, without limitation, negligence), or otherwise
                        excepting the case of wilful misconduct or fraud on behalf of E-REC Group Pty Ltd where such
                        liability is restricted to actual damages.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">7. Client Cooperation. The success of consulting work requires your timely
                        cooperation in a number of ways including without limitation: (a) provision of staff to work with
                        E-REC Group Pty Ltd; (b) availability of senior executives for consultation with E-REC Group Pty
                        Ltd; (c) provision of information and data; (d) decisions as required by the agreed program; and/or
                        (e) provision of reasonable working facilities for E-REC Group Pty Ltd, if applicable. You are
                        responsible for such cooperation and recognize that additional consulting fees and expenses may
                        arise from failure or delay by you to provide, or in providing, the required cooperation.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">8. Staff. Work is undertaken on the understanding that neither E-REC Group
                        Pty Ltd nor you will offer or cause to be offered employment to the staff of the other during the
                        currency of the assignment and six (6) months thereafter, without first receiving written consent
                        from the other Party. E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s staff will always remain under the guidance, direction
                        and control of E-REC Group Pty Ltd.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">9. Disclaimer. You acknowledge that E-REC Group Pty Ltd’s work involves
                        making judgments which may be affected by unforeseen future events including wars, economic
                        disruption, dislocation, business cycles vicissitudes, industrial relations, labour difficulties,
                        political action and other factors the effects of which are not capable of precise assessment and
                        that in many cases E-REC Group Pty Ltd is required to make value judgments based on material
                        compiled by government agencies, scientific organizations and others. It is agreed by the Parties
                        that although E-REC Group Pty Ltd is required to employ or engage experienced and skilled personnel
                        and apply sound business principles in carrying out its obligations, neither E-REC Group Pty Ltd or
                        any of the persons employed or engaged by it shall in any circumstances be liable for any loss or
                        damage which may be sustained by you or any other person, as a result of the work whether this
                        included reliance on the E-REC Group Pty Ltd work or not.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">10. Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute between you and E-REC
                        Group Pty Ltd that cannot be resolved by negotiation, both Parties agree that the dispute may be
                        submitted to a mutually acceptable independent dispute resolution mechanism. If such Services have
                        been performed in a foreign jurisdiction, E-REC Group Pty Ltd agrees to submit to the independent
                        dispute resolution mechanism of that jurisdiction.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">11. Force Majeure. E-REC Group Pty Ltd shall not be liable for any delays or
                        other non-performance resulting from circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control,
                        including, without limitation, fire or other casualty, act of God, strike or labour dispute, war or
                        other violence, or any law, order or requirement of any governmental agency or authority. You shall
                        pay to E-REC Group Pty Ltd the extra costs and expenses incurred by E-REC Group Pty Ltd in the
                        supply of the Services as a result of Force Majeure.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">12. Non-Exclusivity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
                        precluding or limiting in any way the right of E-REC Group Pty Ltd to provide consulting, auditing
                        or other services of any kind or nature whatsoever to any person or entity as E-REC Group Pty Ltd in
                        its sole discretion deems appropriate.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13. Limitation on Actions. No action, regardless of form, arising under or
                        relating to this Agreement, may be brought by either Party more than one year after the cause of
                        action has accrued, except that an action for non-payment may be brought by a Party not later than
                        two years following the date of the last payment due to such Party hereunder.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">14. Independent Contractor. It is understood and agreed that each of the
                        Parties hereto is an independent contractor and that neither Party is, nor shall be considered to
                        be, an agent, distributor or representative of the other. Neither Party shall act or represent
                        itself, directly or by implication, as an agent of the other or in any manner assume or create any
                        obligation on behalf of, or in the name of, the other.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">15. Survival. Each Party acknowledges and agrees with the other that the
                        undertakings given in relation to Confidential Information and Intellectual Property Rights shall
                        survive the termination of the Agreement and shall continue in force until such time as the
                        Confidential Information becomes public knowledge other than by breach of this Agreement.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">16. Notices. Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and may be
                        delivered by hand, by registered mail, by facsimile, or email to the addresses of the Parties
                        specified in or notified pursuant to this Agreement. Notice will be deemed given:(a) in the case of
                        hand delivery or registered mail, upon written acknowledgment of receipt by an officer or other duly
                        authorised employee, agent or representative of the receiving Party;(b) in the case of a facsimile
                        or email (admin@E-REC Group Pty Ltd), upon proof of completion of transmission. Date of receipt is
                        registered prior to 1600 hrs. Notice received after 1600hrs will be dated the following business
                        day.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">17. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including any Exhibits annexed hereto and
                        made a part hereof, constitutes the entire Agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the
                        subject matter hereof and supersedes all other oral or written representations, understandings or
                        agreements relating to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is declared or
                        found to be illegal, unenforceable or void, then such provision shall be null and void but each
                        other provision hereof not so affected shall be enforced to the full extent permitted by applicable
                        law. The paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and
                        shall not affect the meaning or interpretation hereof. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the
                        benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and assigns.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">18. If this contract is with E-REC Group (E-REC Group Pty Ltd), Australia,
                        such jurisdiction governs the interpretation of this contract and applies to claims for breach of
                        it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. If this contract is with a E-REC Group Pty Ltd
                        subsidiary and/or you receive the Service in a jurisdiction with which E-REC Group Pty Ltd has
                        incorporated subsidiary, the laws of the place of incorporation for that E-REC Group Pty Ltd
                        subsidiary shall govern the interpretation of this contract and apply to claims for breach of it,
                        regardless of conflict of laws principles. All other claims, including claims under consumer
                        protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort will be adjudicated under the laws of your
                        state of residence in the United States, or, if you reside outside Australia, under the laws of the
                        country in which the Services are performed. Any failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement
                        shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision hereof. This Agreement may not be
                        amended, nor any obligation waived, except in writing signed by both Parties hereto.</p>
