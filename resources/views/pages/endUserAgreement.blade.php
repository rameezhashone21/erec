                    <h3 class="fw-500 primary-color fs-5">Agreement Between You and E-rec.com.au</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">This is a Terms of Service Agreement between E-REC Group Pty Ltd (hereinafter
                        referred to as “E-rec.com.au”, “us”, or “we”) and you that governs all access to and use of our
                        Services (the “Agreement” or “Terms”). This Agreement applies to e-rec.com.au services as provided
                        through the website, e-rec.com.au, including software, software updates, software upgrades,
                        documentation, reports, and content (e.g., audio and visual information) contained or made available
                        to you in the course of your using the Service (collectively referred to as the “Service”).</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">Please read this Agreement carefully. The Service may have other posted
                        notices or codes of conduct. All such notices and codes of conduct are incorporated by reference
                        into this Agreement. By subscribing to and/or using any of the Service, you agree to be bound by
                        this Agreement, including any modifications made to it from time to time. If you do not agree to the
                        terms and conditions in this Agreement, do not subscribe to or use the Service.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">“You” and “your” means you, your company, your employees, and your agents
                        whom you have designated as “authorized users” or “administrators” of the Service and your account.
                        If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent
                        that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">1. Your Account.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">1.1. Initiating Service. Following receipt of payment for those charges
                        specified in the Subscription page as payable in advance, E-rec.com.au will activate your account
                        and begin providing the Services (the date of the initial service activation represents the “Service
                        Activation or Provisioning Date”). The initial process creates your unique account, and enables you
                        to log in and access the Services. Once we have enabled your account, you will need to visit our
                        online Administrative Site (“Site”) and create an administrative account (an “Admin Account”). When
                        you create your Admin Account, you will create your own password, which you must use in order to
                        access and use the Services. You agree that any information you provide in creating your Admin
                        Account is complete and accurate, and you agree to keep it up to date. For example, we provide some
                        notices by email to your Admin Account, and you agree to keep that email current and valid as a
                        method for providing notices under these Terms. Prices and terms of payment for the Service options
                        you select are stated in your Subscription page.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">1.2. Administering Your Account. Anyone who accesses the Services is a
                        “User”. Your administrators and supervisors can manage your use of the Services as well as perform
                        other administrative functions. Individuals permitted to access the Services for the purpose of
                        making and receiving calls are “Agents.” Each User who accesses the Services through your login
                        account must be covered by a paid subscription and must be your employee, consultant, contractor or
                        agent. User subscriptions can be used concurrently by up to the number of paid Agents identified in
                        your Subscription page. You are responsible for selecting your passwords, maintaining the
                        confidentiality of your passwords, and internal management or administration of the Services for
                        your Users. You agree that E-rec.com.au has no liability with regard to the use of such passwords by
                        third parties. You agree to notify us immediately if you have any reason to believe that the
                        security of your account has been compromised.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">2. Data Privacy and Retention.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">We will comply with the Privacy Policy (found at
                        https://e-rec.com.au/privacy-policy/) in handling and using your User Data, and we will maintain
                        administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality
                        and integrity of your User Data that are consistent with industry standards for similar services.
                        You too shall comply with the Privacy Policy and shall not disclose to third parties or use
                        E-rec.com.au Data except as expressly permitted under these Terms. “User Data” means the information
                        submitted by users into our system, including information derived from such submissions, data about
                        the configuration and use of the Services, account information, call recordings & media logs, credit
                        card information, bank account information, accounting information, transactions and reports.
                        “E-rec.com.au Data” means the information on the Subscription page and information provided to you
                        via login to our Site. Accumulating User Data, including but not limited to, call recordings, chat
                        logs, and email chains, is held for a rolling twelve (12) month period. Charges for accumulating
                        data will not exceed $10 per Gigabyte (GB) per month if hosted by E-rec.com.au. Upon termination,
                        User Data will not be held longer than three (3) months before being deleted.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">3. Accessing and Using Our Site and Services.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">3.1. Subscription Services. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of

                        may use the Services solely for your internal business purposes or as otherwise specified in the
                        Subscription page.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">3.2. Restrictions. You will not nor will you allow any third party to:
                        modify, copy, or otherwise reproduce the Services in whole or in part; reverse engineer, decompile,
                        disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code form or structure of the software used
                        in the Services; provide, lease or lend the Services to any third party; remove any proprietary
                        notices or labels displayed on the Services; modify or create a derivative work of any part of the
                        Services; or use the Services for any unlawful purpose or contrary to this Agreement. You will (1)
                        ensure that your Users comply with this Agreement; (2) use commercially reasonable efforts to
                        prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services; and (3) use the Services only in accordance
                        with the User Guide and applicable laws and government regulations (including without limitation
                        those more fully described in Section 7 below, as well as HIPAA, and export control laws and
                        regulations).</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">4. Our Provision of the Services.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">4.1. User Guide. We describe the main functions of our Services in the
                        instructions and manuals we make available via login to our software (our “User Guide”). We update
                        and enhance the Services, and will update the User Guide from time to time.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">4.2. Technical Support. As part of our Services, we will make our standard
                        technical support available to you. Our support services and options are more fully described in
                        Appendix B of our Terms of Service document. Such support may, in E-rec.com.au’s discretion, include
                        on-line help, FAQ’s, training guides and templates and the use of live help.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">4.3. Other Services from E-rec.com.au. E-rec.com.au may also provide other
                        services, such as Professional Services, including but not limited to consulting, training, or
                        development services. Any such services or requirements not expressly stated in this Agreement are
                        outside the scope of this Agreement and are subject to the Professional Services Standard Terms and
                        Conditions available at https://e-rec.com.au/</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">5. Technical Requirements for Use of Our Services.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">In order to utilize the Services, you will need to adhere to certain
                        technical specifications and have certain minimum hardware, software and Internet connectivity, as
                        specified in our Terms of Service document (“Required Equipment”). With your cooperation, and prior
                        to activation of your Services, we will conduct an assessment of your Required Equipment. We may
                        recommend adjustments to the Required Equipment in order to meet the minimum technical requirements
                        to utilize the Services. You are responsible for implementing any recommendations we make in this
                        regard and also for the ownership and ongoing maintenance of Required Equipment. E-rec.com.au’s
                        recommendations with respect to Required Equipment do not constitute a guarantee or warranty as to
                        the future suitability of the Required Equipment for operating the Services. You acknowledge and
                        agree that, at all times, you are solely responsible for obtaining and supporting Required Equipment
                        as necessary to use the Services. Your failure to have the Required Equipment is not a basis for
                        terminating this Agreement or seeking a refund.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">6. Possible Suspension or Termination of Service for Non-Compliance. If, for
                        any reason, E-rec.com.au reasonably believes that your use of the Services is violating federal,
                        state, and/or local rules or regulations, or is harassing to consumers or businesses, E-rec.com.au
                        may suspend its Service to prevent further calling of those numbers through its Service. In
                        addition, E-rec.com.au may review your Service settings and/or require that you promptly provide
                        E-rec.com.au with copies of your written telemarketing policies, procedures, and employee/customer
                        training documents that you rely upon to demonstrate telemarketing compliance. Pursuant to Sections
                        7.1 and 9.2 of these Terms, E-rec.com.au may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if it
                        reasonably determines that you are not in compliance with federal, state, and/or local telemarketing
                        regulations, if you fail to timely respond to E-rec.com.au’s request for materials, or if
                        E-rec.com.au otherwise believes that your use of the Services may present an unreasonable risk of
                        harm to E-rec.com.au or to others.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">7. Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">Except as expressly stated, this Agreement does not grant either party any
                        rights, implied or otherwise, to the other’s intellectual property (“IP Rights”). You own all IP
                        Rights in your User Data and, as between us, E-rec.com.au owns all IP Rights in the Site, Services,
                        our trademarks and E-rec.com.au Data. We welcome your suggestions and feedback on how to improve the
                        Services. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">7. 1 If you provide any suggestions, feedback, or improvements to the Site
                        or Services, we will have the right to use and have others use such suggestions, feedback, and
                        improvements for any purpose. Each party hereby makes any assignments necessary to accomplish the
                        ownership provisions in this paragraph and will provide reasonable assistance to the other for such
                        purposes. The Site, Services, and E-rec.com.au Data are commercial items. If they are being used by
                        or on behalf of the Australian Government, then the rights in them will be only those specified in
                        this Agreement. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">9. Term and Termination.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">9.1. Term. Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, this
                        Agreement commences on the Service Activation Date and shall continue for three (3) months (“Initial
                        Term”) and shall automatically renew for consecutive monthly (1) periods (each a “Renewal Period”
                        and all Renewal Periods together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) thereafter, unless either party
                        has provided notice of its intent not to renew this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.3. In no
                        event may you terminate this Agreement on less than thirty (30) days written notice to us. Either
                        party may terminate this Agreement for cause on thirty (30) days written notice of a material breach
                        to the other party if the breach remains uncured at the expiration of the notice period. Non-payment
                        of any service or other fees due is a material breach. If you materially breach this Agreement, we
                        may, without limitation of our other rights and remedies, withhold further performance of our
                        obligations under this Agreement.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">9.2. Suspension of Services. We may suspend or terminate your use of the
                        Services if we have reason to believe: (i) you are using the Services in a manner that may cause
                        harm to us or to a third party, including actions that violate any applicable laws, rules or
                        regulations, including the federal and state telemarketing laws and regulations; (ii) your use is
                        compromising the security of the Services or the privacy of our other customers; or (iii) you are
                        engaging in other activity that could cause harm to us or a third party.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">9.3. Effect of Termination. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement
                        or a Subscription page for any reason: (1) all applicable licenses and other rights granted to you
                        will immediately terminate; (2) we will make your User Data available to you (either from
                        E-rec.com.au or through a third party offsite storage provider) for up to thirty (30) days after
                        termination. After that thirty (30) day period, you will lose access to any data and we will have no
                        obligation to maintain any, and will have the right to delete, all data related to the expired or
                        terminated Agreement or Subscription page and we will have no further obligation to make such data
                        available to you. Termination will not relieve you of the obligation to pay any fees due or payable
                        to E-rec.com.au incurred prior to the effective date of termination, including annual fees,
                        implementation fees, training fees, User subscription fees, or any other fees or payments due under
                        the Agreement. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">10. Warranties.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">10.1. Warranty. Each party represents and warrants to the other party that
                        (i) it has the power and authority to enter into and perform all obligations under this Agreement,
                        and (ii) it will comply with all applicable laws in its performance under this Agreement.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">10.2. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
                        PROVIDED HEREIN, E-REC.COM.AU DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, THIRD-PARTY
                        SERVICES, OR MATERIALS PROVIDED BY E-REC.COM.AU, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY OPERATION OF LAW,
                        REPRESENTATION STATEMENTS, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
                        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. EACH PARTY WILL BE SOLELY AND
                        INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO ITS RESPECTIVE BUSINESS
                        OPERATIONS. You agree that the Services may be inaccessible or inoperable due to scheduled periodic
                        maintenance and upgrades or for reasons beyond our reasonable control including but not limited to
                        (i) equipment malfunctions, or (ii) service interruptions caused by independent telecommunications
                        providers that provide voice and data connectivity to your or our data centers.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">11. Mutual Indemnification.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">11.1. Our Indemnity. We will defend, indemnify and hold you harmless against
                        any claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), or damages arising from or
                        relating to a third party claim alleging that your use of the Services infringes or misappropriates
                        any U.S. patent, copyright, or trade secret of a third party. The foregoing indemnity does not
                        extend to claims arising from or relating to third-party Services or claims covered by your
                        indemnification in Section 11.2 of this Agreement. In the event of a claim or threatened claim under
                        this Section by a third party, we may, at our sole option, (A) revise the Services so that they are
                        no longer infringing, (B) obtain the right for you to continue using the Services, or (C) terminate
                        this Agreement and any applicable Subscription page upon fifteen (15) days’ notice.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">11.2. Your Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify and hold us harmless
                        against any claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable and all attorney’s fees) or damages
                        arising from or relating to a third-party claim related to or arising from your use of the Services
                        other than those for which we will indemnify you under Section 11.1.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">11.3. Procedures. The party entitled to be indemnified (the “Indemnified
                        Party”) will give prompt written notice to the other party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of any claim
                        for which indemnification may be required under this Agreement. Failure to give such notice will not
                        relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to provide indemnification except if and to the
                        extent that such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Party to
                        defend the applicable claim. If the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party of any claim
                        asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges is
                        a claim for which it must indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Agreement, the Indemnifying
                        Party will be entitled to assume the defense and control of any such claim at its own cost and
                        expense and the Indemnified Party will have the right to be represented by its own counsel at its
                        own cost in such matters. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party will settle or
                        dispose of any such matter in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or interests of the
                        other party (including the obligation to indemnify hereunder) without the prior written consent of
                        the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party will reasonably
                        cooperate with the other party and its counsel in the course of the defense of any such suit, claim
                        or demand, such cooperation to include without limitation using reasonable efforts to provide or
                        make available documents, information and witnesses.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">11.4. THIS SECTION 11 (MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION) REPRESENTS THE SOLE AND
                        EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR
                        ANY TYPE OF CLAIM DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 11.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">12. Limitation of Liability.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">EXCEPT FOR EITHER PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 11
                        (MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL,
                        INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL AND PUNITIVE/EXEMPLARY DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
                        APPLICABLE LAW, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS
                        AGREEMENT, EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH A
                        MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 2 (DATA PRIVACY) OR SECTION
                        11 (MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION), THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ONE PARTY TO THE OTHER FOR DAMAGES UNDER OR
                        ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION (AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN
                        TORT) WILL BE LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAYABLE TO E-REC.COM.AU IN ONE (1) MONTH OF SERVICE OR THE
                        EQUIVALENT OF $50 AUD (WHICHEVER IS GREATER) PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13. Miscellaneous.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.1. Counterparts; Fax and/or Scanned Signatures. The Agreement may be
                        accepted as set forth in the preamble above by signing the Terms of Service document and returning a
                        signed copy to us by facsimile or a scanned copy through email to finance@E-rec.com.au. This
                        Agreement (including any amendment thereto and/or Subscription page) may be executed simultaneously
                        in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together
                        constitute one and the same Agreement. The parties agree that facsimile and/or scanned signatures
                        are valid signatures for enforcement of the Agreement.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.2. Governing Law; Venue. The validity, construction and interpretation of
                        the Agreement will be governed by the laws of each state, excluding its conflict of law’s
                        provisions. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.3. Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement to a third party by
                        operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.4. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for inadequate performance
                        to the extent caused by a condition (for example, natural disaster, act of war or terrorism, riot,
                        labour condition, governmental action, and Internet disturbance) that was beyond the party’s
                        reasonable control.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.5. Independent Contractors. The parties are and will remain independent
                        contractors. Neither party has any authority to act on behalf of the other party nor to bind it, nor
                        in no event will the parties be construed to be partners, employer-employee, or agents of each
                        other.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.6. Interpretation. Headings in the Agreement are for reference purposes
                        only and will not affect the interpretation or meaning of the Agreement. If any provision of the
                        Agreement is held by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then
                        the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. No delay or omission
                        by either party to exercise any right or power it has under the Agreement will be construed as a
                        waiver of such right or power. A waiver by either party of any breach by the other party will not be
                        construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach or any other covenant by the other party. All
                        waivers must be in writing and signed by the party waiving its rights.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.7. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. This Agreement constitutes the
                        entire agreement between E-rec.com.au and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
                        Agreement supersedes all negotiations, agreements, and undertakings between the parties with respect
                        to such subject matter, including terms contained in any purchase order or similar document which
                        you may submit to E-rec.com.au; and, the parties acknowledge that they have not relied on any
                        representations outside of this Agreement in deciding to enter into this Agreement. If a
                        Subscription page conflicts with these Terms, the Subscription page will prevail, but only with
                        respect to the subject matter of the conflicting Subscription page.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">13.9. Amendments. From time to time, E-rec.com.au may amend these Terms in
                        its sole discretion. E-rec.com.au will post the amended terms on the E-rec.com.au website and will
                        further notify you of any material changes by promptly sending an email or posting a notice in your
                        Admin Account. By continuing to access or use the Services after E-rec.com.au has provided you with
                        such notice of a change, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. Any
                        renewed subscription will be governed by E-rec.com.au’s then-current Terms.</p>
